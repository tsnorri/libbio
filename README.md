# libbio

Classes and functions for use with bioinformatics.

Features include:

- VCF parsing
- FASTA parsing
- Positional Burrows-Wheeler transform
- Using C++ lambda functions with [libdispatch](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-libdispatch)

Most of the API should be considered unstable, though.
